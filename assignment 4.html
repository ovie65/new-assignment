    <p><h2>In JavaScript, there are two types of equality operators: the loose equality operator and the strict equality operator.

        The loose equality operator == checks if two values are equal, but it performs type coercion, meaning that it can convert the types of the operands to make the comparison. For example, 5 == '5' would return true, because the string '5' is converted to the number 5 for the comparison.
        
        The strict equality operator === checks if two values are equal without performing type coercion. It only returns true if the operands have the same type and the same value. For example, 5 === '5' would return false, because the types of the operands are different.
        
        The inequality operators work similarly. The loose inequality operator != checks if two values are not equal, but it also performs type coercion. For example, 5 != '6' would return true, because the string '6' is converted to the number 6 for the comparison.
        
        The strict inequality operator !== checks if two values are not equal without performing type coercion. It returns true if the operands have different types or different values. For example, 5 !== '5' would return true, because the types of the operands are different.
        
        In summary:
        
        ==: loose equality operator, checks if two values are equal after type coercion
        ===: strict equality operator, checks if two values are equal without type coercion
        !=: loose inequality operator, checks if two values are not equal after type coercion
        !==: strict inequality operator, checks if two values are not equal without type coercion
