    <p><h3>Short history on JavaScript JavaScript is a programming language that was 
    created by Brendan Eich in just 10 days in May 1995.</h3></p>
    <p>
        It was initially designed to be used in web browsers as a client-side scripting language, allowing developers to add interactivity to web pages. The name "JavaScript" was chosen by Eich's employer at the time, Netscape Communications, to capitalize on the popularity of the then-dominant programming language, Java.
        JavaScript quickly gained popularity among web developers due to its ability to create dynamic and interactive web pages. In 1997, the language was standardized by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) as ECMAScript. This standardization helped to increase the credibility of JavaScript as a programming language.
        In the early 2000s, the rise of web applications and the development of AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) further cemented JavaScript's place as a key technology for web development. Today, JavaScript is one of the most widely-used programming languages in the world, with an estimated 95% of all websites using it in some form. It is also used outside of web development, in areas such as server-side programming and game development.
        JavaScript continues to evolve and adapt to meet the needs of modern web development. The latest version of the language, ECMAScript 2022, includes new features and improvements to make it easier for developers to write complex web applications.
